# What is it?
It's a public repository with all the digital materials I created / modified while studiing at MFF CUNI. The vast mojority of them were intended for my personal use only so don't expect _publishable_ quality.

#Acknowledgement:
Due to the fact that I was unable to find what exact licences were some of here-posted-materials published under it is possible that some of them are here ilegaly (though only publicly available resources are here, always with links to original source). So, if you're rights owner / you're sure that something I have here shouldn't be here please let me know, I'll remove it immediately.
